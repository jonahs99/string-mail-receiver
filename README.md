# Receive Morse code over a tin can telephone

This is the receiver app for a [hackathon project](https://devpost.com/software/conecting-the-unconnected) at MakeUofT 2019. The app takes input from the computers audio input, filters and cleans for a buzzer signal, decodes the Morse code and displays the output on screen.
